Using the DJIA data for IBM stock performance between 2006 and 2018 (obtained from using the scraper shown here https://github.com/szrlee/Stock-Time-Series-Analysis/blob/master/data_collection.ipynb), two methods of time-series forecasting, ARIMA and LSTM, were explored and compared. The LSTM method performed the best, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.59%, while ARIMA had a MAPE of 8.67%.

Special thanks to the many Keggle users whose example Kernals helped me better understand how to best apply the LSTM and ARIMA models.
